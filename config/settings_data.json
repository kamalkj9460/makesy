Wooden wicks create a unique horizontal flame.In larger diameter candles, wooden wicks can produce a full melt pool with only one wick eliminating the need to use multiple wicks (in most cases). Wooden wicks create an alluring crackling sound when burning for added ambiance. Being rigid, wooden wicks are very easy to use, saving time and money in production. There is no need to secure to a wick bar or dowels and no straightening is needed as there is with cotton wicks, which require a great deal of time to set up. Wooden wicks do not mushroom, have little to no carbon build-up, no debris and no sooting like cotton wicks. Wooden wicks are completely American made, being sourced and manufactured in the USA from the Forest Stewardship Council. There are multiple options available for optimal performance as well as visual aesthetic when using wooden wicks compared to cotton wicks. Wooden wicks provide a modern, unique and more upscale look to enhance a candle's value.<\/p>"}},"1598820336916":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Is it difficult to make a candle with a wooden wick?","answer":"<p>Making candles with wooden wicks isn't that different from making candles with cotton wicks. In fact, it's actually a little easier and less time consuming as there's no need to straighten or secure the wick with wick bars, dowels or sticks.We suggest following this simple guide:<br\/><br\/>Determine your wick size using our <a href=\"\/products\/wick-sample-kit\" title=\"WICK SAMPLE KIT\">sample kit<\/a> and <a href=\"\/pages\/wick-selection-guide\" title=\"WICK SELECTION GUIDE\">wick selection guide<\/a>. Secure your wooden wick into the wick clip. Secure the wick clip to the bottom center of your vessel with a wick sticker. Heat your wax to the specified temperature for your wax type. Add your candle scent and dye, if any, to the melted wax in the pouring pitcher (fragrance level and dye have a direct impact on the burn of a candle and you will need to experiment with different levels to achieve optimum performance). Gently pour the wax into the vessel, leaving 1\/8″ - 3\/16″ \/ 3.2Mm - 4.8Mm of the wick exposed. If the wick is longer you can trim it to this height after the wax has set. After the candle has cooled: if the surface is uneven or has imperfections, you can carefully use a heat gun to even it out. Be very careful not to burn the wick, this is a quick process of gently waving the heat gun a few inches above the surface to quickly melt it.Once the candle has set, trim the wick to 1\/8″ - 3\/16″ \/ 3.2mm - 4.8mm.<\/p>"}},"1598820467490":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What makes wooden wicks unique?","answer":"<p>Candle making has evolved from an ancient art born of necessity to a modern day luxury.

For example, if you are at The Enthusiast ($250 threshold), and EARN that level on August 8th, you have until August 8th the following year to reach the qualified spend level amount ($250) again – or your tier will reset to the Enthusiast. When you move up a tier, that erases your previous “earn date” and replaces it with the new date when you reached the newest tier. You have 12 months to maintain that newly acquired tier.<\/p>"}},"31eacc03-9576-4b76-bae2-edba7d8f4915":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"How do I get points for following on social media?","answer":"<p>Simply log in to your account and go to the The Perks dashboard.
